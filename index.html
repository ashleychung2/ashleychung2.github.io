        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello there! I'm Ashley Chung, a 19-year-old student currently pursuing a major in sociology at UC Riverside. My academic journey has been an exciting and diverse one, as I am currently taking courses on geology, computer science, and macroeconomics. I find joy in exploring the intersections between these disciplines, allowing me to develop a well-rounded understanding of the world around me.
My passion for sociology stems from a deep curiosity about human behavior and societal structures. I believe that studying sociology provides valuable insights into the intricacies of our interconnected world. As I progress through my coursework, I am eager to apply theoretical knowledge to real world situations and contribute meaningfully to the field.
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively seeking internship opportunities in sociology to gain hands-on experience and further refine my skills. The prospect of applying classroom knowledge to practical scenarios excites me, and I am optimistic about finding an internship that aligns with my interests and career goals.
My academic journey is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and exploration. While sociology is my primary focus, I have found an interset in geology since it has provided me with a unique perspective on Earth's processes and history. Similarly, taking CS has equipped me with problem solving skills and a technical mindset, which I believe complements my sociological studies. Macroeconomics, on the other hand, has enhanced my understanding of global economic systems, and the flow of our current market, adding another layer to my interdisciplinary approach to education.
Looking ahead, I am set to graduate in the spring of 2026, graduating with a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of the complexities of human society. My academic journey has been filled with challenges and triumphs, all of which have contributed to my growth as an individual and a future professional in the field of sociology.
In the coming months, I am excited about the prospect of securing a summer internship that will allow me to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting. This experience will not only enhance my skills but also provide valuable insights that will shape my future career path.
As I navigate the exciting world of academia and professional development, I invite you to join me on this journey. I will be updating my internship search, reflections on my coursework, and insights into the fascinating intersections of sociology, geology, computer science, and macroeconomics.
